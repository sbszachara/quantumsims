# Quantum Error Management Simulation Framework

This is a simple prototype framework for experimenting with adaptive quantum error management. It shows how basic bandit algorithms, noise prediction, and mitigation strategies can be combined into a small end to end simulation. It uses Qiskit to run a toy quantum circuit and then applies error correction or mitigation choices.

## Installation

Files included:
bandit.py
ml_models.py
quantum_sim.py
run_simulation.py

Requirements:
Python 3.8+
qiskit
numpy

Install dependencies with:
pip install qiskit numpy qiskit-aer

## Running the simulation

From the project directory run:
python run_simulation.py

This will run 10 trials of the simulation and print results to the console.

## What happens

Each trial goes through a few steps:

1. A context is chosen at random. Contexts are idle, coherent-noise, or readout-error.

2. A bandit algorithm (Contextual Thompson Sampling) picks a QEC strategy. Strategies are full_qec, light_qec, or inaction. A small safety check may override unsafe choices.

3. The toy quantum circuit is run in Qiskit with that strategy. The result is a fidelity value.

4. Another bandit (non-stationary) chooses a post-processing mitigation. Options are zne, pec, mem, or none. This adjusts the fidelity further.

5. Final fidelity is printed.

After 10 trials it prints "Simulation complete."

## File overview

bandit.py: small implementations of ContextualTSBandit and NSBandit for strategy selection.
ml_models.py: stub functions for noise prediction and mitigation gain prediction.
quantum_sim.py: runs a simple one qubit circuit in Qiskit Aer and estimates fidelity under different strategies.
run_simulation.py: the main driver that ties everything together.

## Notes

This is a rough prototype meant to show the idea. It could be extended with better models, more realistic circuits, and more advanced bandit algorithms. Right now the ML models are placeholders and the noise/fidelity mapping is simplistic. It is enough to demonstrate the basic flow of adaptive quantum error management in a lightweight way.
